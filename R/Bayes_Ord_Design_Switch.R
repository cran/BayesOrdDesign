#' Determine the sample size for Bayesian two-stage trial design for
#' ordinal endpoints based on switch model
#'
#' @description
#' When there lacks of sufficient information to determine which of these two
#' models (PO or NPO) is more appropriate, PO/NPO switch model-based design is
#' utilized to obtain estimated sample size based on user specified type I
#' error, power and expected effect.
#'
#' @returns ss_switch() returns recommended sample size for each group at every
#' interim look, with assumption that the sample size in the control arm of the
#' study is same as in the treatment arm, and the sample size at each interim
#' look is same.
#' @export
#' @param alpha the desirable type I error rate to be controlled
#' @param power the desirable power to be achieved
#' @param n_po sample size for the treatment and control groups, at each stage
#' based on PO model
#' @param n_npo sample size for the treatment and control groups, at each stage
#' based on NPO model
#' @param or_alt expected treatment efficacy effect size to be
#' detected (under H_1) in terms of odds ratio
#' @param pro_ctr distribution of clinical categories for the
#' control group
#' @param U the desirability of each outcome level
#' @param ntrial the number of simulated trials
#' @param method whether the statistical test for interim/final analysis is Bayesian or
#' Frequentist. method = "Frequentist" for Frequentist approach; method = "Bayesian"
#' for Bayesian approach
#' @param n_range the additional sample size for each arm each stage after n_po, n_npo.
#'
#' @details
#'   Grid search of sample size is used for guarantee a desirable type I error rate.
#'   The upper limitation is 200, and lower limitation default is sample size 50
#'   for the control and treatment groups at each stage. Default increment of the
#'   sequence is 10.
#'
#'   For the parameter estimation section, we have two options, and can be selected using
#'   the method argument.Two following options are available: (i) method = "Frequentist",
#'   (ii) method = "Bayesian". If method = "Frequentist", parameters are estimated via package
#'   ordinal, which is based on frequentist method, while method = "Bayesian", parameters are
#'   estimated through Bayesian model.
#'
#'   Specifically, the numerical utilities U reflect the desirability of each outcome
#'   level. To do this, in our example, we first set U[1] = 100 and U[5] = 0, and then
#'   asked physicians to specify numerical values for the intermediate levels, that
#'   reflect their desirability relative to the best and worst levels.
#'
#'   Arguments n_po and n_npo are the estimated sample size for the treatment and
#'   control groups at each stage based on PO model and NPO model respectively. Users can
#'   obtained them through function ss_po and ss_npo.
